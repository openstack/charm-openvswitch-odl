summary: Open vSwitch OpenDayLight subordinate charm
description:
 Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer, software-based,
 Ethernet virtual switch. It is designed to enable massive network
 automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting
 standard management interfaces and protocols (e.g. NetFlow, IPFIX,
 sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In addition, it is designed
 to support distribution across multiple physical servers similar to
 VMware's vNetwork distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus 1000V.
 .
 OpenDaylight is a network virtualization solution that provides an
 overlay virtual-network to virtual-machines, containers or network
 namespaces.
 .
 This charm integrates Open vSwitch into OpenDayLight as part of an
 OpenStack Cloud.
